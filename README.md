# Change File Icon

## About
Application for changing file icons

### NOTE:
Images are copied to the application destination and stored under a name that represents the hash of the image.
It means that any change in the path where the application is located will cause all folders to lose their icons, and they will need to be set again.
Therefore, the preferred installation path is ```C:/```

## Installation
Download the latest release and extract it to the location where the application should stay.
Next, create a shortcut to the executable file located in ```SetOwnIco/SetOwnIcon.exe```
